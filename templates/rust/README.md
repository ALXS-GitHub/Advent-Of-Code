## Rust Template

Do you want to use my rust template for your own solutions? 

Then just get the `template` folder from this repository and use the following command to create a new day:

```sh
cargo generate --path ./template
```

Then it will ask you for the project name, just enter the name you want to give for the day and it will create a new folder with the template code for you.
