# Templates

Here you can find all my templates for the Advent of Code challenges.

For the moment, I only have a template for rust, but if I decide to do the challenges in another language, I will add templates for those as well.

The templates may change over time, as I find better ways to structure my workflow and find better complementary tools to use.

You can find instructions on how to use the templates in the `README.md` file of each template.
