## AI Usage Rules

For the Advent of Code challenges, I allow the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to assist me. However, I adhere to the following rules to ensure the provided solutions remain my own work. 

The rules are very simple, I can only use AI tools to help me with technical aspects, such as syntax, debugging, or language features. I do not allow AI tools to generate complete solutions or algorithms for me. The logic and problem-solving must be my own.

Any completion tool shouldn't be used to generate the solutions, and only the 'Ask' agent mode is allowed for chat-based tools.

Examples of acceptable prompts:

- "In Rust, is there a function that I can use to count the number of 1s in a binary representation of an integer or should I implement it myself?"
- "How to define an ordered struct based on the 'name' field in Rust?"
- "How to use the 'group_by' function from the 'itertools' crate in Rust? Can you provide an example?"
- "Can you remind me how to build Dijkstra's algorithm?"
- ...

Examples of unacceptable prompts:
- "Can you provide a complete solution for Day 5? Here is the problem description: ..."
- "Implement a function that solves the knapsack problem given these constraints: ..."
- ...
